## Developing

When in development mode or building the dev build, the engine uses assets in the `src/puzzle/data.dev` and `src/puzzle/assets.dev` folders.

When building the prod build, the engine uses assets in the `src/puzzle/data.prod` and `src/puzzle/assets.prod` folders.

Weâ€™ll refer to these as the `data` and `assets` folder respectively. All chapter data is stored in `*.puzzle.json` files in the `data` folder. If multiple files are found, they will be combined into one. Static assets are stored in the `assets` folder.

For the structure of the `*.puzzle.json` files, refer to [the docs](./docs.md).
